## Self-Evaluation:

how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment:
I deserve an 18/20 on this assignment. I followed along with the lecture videos and made sure my 
game had no errors. The issues I have is that my "player" isn't able to destory the ships. Due to this, 
my score isn't able to update. I used the debugger, rewatched the lecture videos and checked the 
creator's code. I couldn't figure out the issue because everything matched.

## Self-Reflection:
I'm very proud of myself because I was able to create a game. It was really exciting to learn
how to make one and it brought back many childhood memories. 

### How long it took me to finish this?
5 hours
